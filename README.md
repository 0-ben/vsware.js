# vsware.js

A Typescript (compiled to Javascript) wrapper for the user-facing VSWare API. This is not the API you need a key for, all you need is an account.

## Is it within Terms of Service?

### API Terms & Conditions

I don't think this technically even applies, that's about the API you need a key for, but as long as you don't violate IP (that means never publish anything you get from the API) or spam the API, yes.

### Online Payments Terms & Conditions

No payments are processed or supported by vsware.js

### Terms and Conditions

No valid links are included in vsware.js, and as long as you don't spam, yes.
